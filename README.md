# Material Color Utilities Mojo ðŸ”¥

Mojo port of the [Material Color Utilities](https://github.com/material-foundation/material-color-utilities/)

To execute: `mojo blend_test.mojo`

This is what is implemented right now. The most complex, low level stuff are mostly complete, while the higher level stuff (such as palettes, scheme) are still in progress:

- âœ… blend

- âœ… contrast

- âœ… dislike

- [ ] dynamic color

- âœ… hct

- [ ] palettes

- [ ] quantize

- [ ] scheme

- [ ] score

- [ ] temperature

- âœ… utilities

- [ ] tests

As Mojo evolves, it will be fun to use `Tensor` instead of `StaticTuple[3, StaticTuple[3, Float32]]`, add tests, and optimize for paralellization. There are many matrix operations that could be optimized by SIMD.

Material Color Utilities is a fun project. It has implementation in 4 languages (Dart, C++, Swift and TypeScript), they are all tested, and it has periodical usage of matrix operations. It is a great candidate for benchmarking how fast Mojo is.

Initial Benchmark (benchmark_blend.mojo):

- Mojo: 0.8s
- Dart: 1.2s

More benchmarks soon (as well as paralellization).

--- Original README:

Algorithms and utilities that power the Material Design 3 (M3) color system,
including choosing theme colors from images and creating tones of colors; all in a new color space.

### Components

The library is composed of multiple components, each with its own folder and
tests, each as small as possible.

This enables easy merging and updating of subsets into other libraries, such as
Material Design Components, Android System UI, etc. Not all consumers will need
every component â€” ex. MDC doesnâ€™t need quantization/scoring/image extraction.
